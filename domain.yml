      I am delighted to inform you that our restaurant is currently open for dine-ins for fully vaccinated patrons only. Additionally, the current daily SOP in all our restaurants include:-
       1. Our crew members are required to wear face masks and gloves. This includes crew members who are assigned to carry out temperature checks of guests and delivery riders.
       2. After closing hours, we assign a Manager and 4 crew members to carry out detailed cleaning of the store. This covers areas within each restaurant like kitchen, Drive-Thru lane, dining area, and storage areas.
       3. We encourage the usage of cashless payments in all our restaurants nationwide to minimise physical contact between our crew members and the public.
